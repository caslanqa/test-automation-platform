# @pwtap/plugin-maestro

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- eb8214e: Make the Mobile Inspector produce tests that actually run.

  Recording, saving and replaying a mobile flow never worked end to end: the generated test imported a
  fixture nobody wired into the `@fixtures` barrel, omitted the `platform` and `appId` needed to connect,
  pinned an `adb` serial that dies on reboot, ran under the browser project, and asserted visibility through
  an action that could only ever throw. This closes that loop, verified on real Android emulators and iOS
  simulators with both drivers. See `docs/mobile-inspector/architecture.md` for the full design and the
  decision record.

  ### Breaking — `@pwtap/mobile-inspector`
  - The driver/device selection option is now **`mobileTarget`** and the facade fixture is **`mobileApp`**
    (previously `mobile` and `app`). Both old names collided with fixtures the mobile plugins already own —
    `@pwtap/plugin-maestro` owns the `mobile` option and `@pwtap/plugin-appium` owns the `app` fixture — and
    in Playwright an option _is_ a fixture, so the collision was a merge conflict rather than an override.
    `mobileTarget` also gains `appId` and `appSource`, which are now forwarded to the driver instead of
    being dropped.

    ```diff
    - test.use({ mobile: { driver: 'appium', device: 'emulator-5554' } });
    - test('flow', async ({ app }) => { await app.tap({ accessibilityId: 'login' }); });
    + test.use({ mobileTarget: { driver: 'appium', platform: 'android', device: 'Pixel_7_API_34', appId: 'com.example.app' } });
    + test('flow', async ({ mobileApp }) => { await mobileApp.tap({ accessibilityId: 'login' }); });
    ```

  - `MobileApp.isVisible()` now resolves `false` when the element is absent instead of throwing. It is
    backed by a new `isVisible` action in the driver-neutral IR; previously it routed through
    `assertVisible`, which throws on absence, so every generated "assert not visible" failed. Generated code
    now emits `await expect.poll(() => mobileApp.isVisible(...)).toBe(...)`.
  - `MobileInspectorDriver` requires a `testBinding` (`{ extension, project, gateEnv }`). A driver now
    declares where its tests live and how they run, so adding a driver needs no changes inside the inspector.
  - The trust boundary validates an action's fields, not just its `kind`. Payloads like a `fill` with no
    `value` or a `swipe` with an invented `direction` are rejected instead of reaching an adapter.

  ### Breaking — `@pwtap/plugin-maestro`
  - The `maestro` Playwright project now matches **`*.maestro.ts`** instead of `*.mobile.ts`, so a file's
    extension names the driver that runs it for hand-written and recorded tests alike. Existing tests need a
    rename; nothing inside them changes.

    ```bash
    git ls-files 'tests/**/*.mobile.ts' | while read -r f; do
      git mv "$f" "${f%.mobile.ts}.maestro.ts"
    done
    npx create-pwtap add maestro   # re-injects the narrowed project block
    ```

  ### `@pwtap/plugin-appium`
  - Fixed an iOS text locator that could never resolve: node text is read from `label` **or** `value`, but
    the selector only matched `label`, so a locator recorded from a `value`-only element failed with
    "element wasn't found" the first time it replayed.
  - Selector values are now escaped, so UI text containing `"` or `\` no longer breaks the predicate.
  - Implements the new `isVisible` action without throwing on absence.

  ### `@pwtap/create`
  - `PluginManifest.fixture` accepts an array, letting a plugin contribute more than one fixture. Both mobile
    plugins now also contribute the shared `mobileApp` fixture, injected once and — importantly — left in
    place when only one of them is uninstalled.
  - Fixed `hasRegion`, which matched markers as substrings. Because `// pwtap:x:end` contains `// pwtap:x`, a
    file that had lost only its start marker looked intact and then crashed with an unhandled `MarkerError`
    instead of reporting the problem. This affected all four injectors.

### Minor Changes

- d2dff69: Three recording fixes, each verified against a real emulator.

  **Tree selection survives a hierarchy read.** Every read builds a fresh object graph, and the accessibility
  tree compared nodes with `===`, so a selected element silently deselected itself on the next poll while the
  device panel kept highlighting stale bounds. Nodes now carry `path` and `key` (`assignNodeIdentity`), and the
  UI remembers the key and re-resolves it each render.

  **Maestro honours a recorded scroll direction.** The adapter called Maestro's bare `scroll()`, which only
  ever scrolls down, so the direction the user recorded was discarded; it now issues a directional swipe.
  `scroll` with `within` is refused with a clear message rather than silently scrolling the whole screen and
  producing a test that merely looks like it scrolls a container.

  **A locator from another app is flagged, not ranked highly.** A whole-screen hierarchy includes other apps'
  elements, and tapping one can succeed while the replay fails, because a driver is scoped to an app id. Such
  a node now loses 60 points and carries an explicit warning. Detection is partial by platform: Appium Android
  reports the owning package per node, while Maestro's payload has no package field at all — see §7 of
  `docs/mobile-inspector/architecture.md`.

  **Also:** the Maestro adapter was dropping `cls`, `enabled` and `val` from every node, which left the whole
  hierarchy unlabelled in the tree (91 nodes on a real screen, 0 with a class name) and weakened the new
  identity key. `val` now folds into `text`, matching how the Appium adapter already folds iOS `value`.

- d434c7f: Take Electron out of the mobile stack, and split the runtime contracts away from the recorder.

  Installing a mobile plugin used to drag ~306 MB into a project that might never open the recorder: Electron
  (296 MB), a second copy of Prettier (9.6 MB) and a WebSocket library, all reachable because the plugins
  depended on the recording _application_ to get at a handful of types. That is now ≈0. Phase 1 of
  `docs/mobile-inspector/architecture.md`; the recorder itself keeps working, hosted in a browser window
  instead of an Electron shell.

  ### New — `@pwtap/mobile-core`

  The driver-neutral contracts a _test_ actually loads: the action IR and types, the locator engine, device
  discovery, the `./inspector` adapter registry, and the `mobileApp` fixture. Its only dependency is
  `@pwtap/platform`. Both mobile plugins now depend on this instead of on `@pwtap/mobile-inspector`, which the
  adapters had only ever used for types plus three pure helpers.

  ### Breaking — `@pwtap/mobile-inspector`
  - **Now a development tool, injected as a `devDependency`** by the mobile plugins' manifests rather than
    pulled in as a runtime dependency. It is not in the path of a test run.
  - **The runtime surface moved to `@pwtap/mobile-core`.** Type-only re-exports remain for one minor, so
    existing type imports get a deprecation rather than a build error; the runtime values (the `test`/`expect`
    fixture, the locator helpers) are deliberately not re-exported, because a test importing them from here
    would be loading a dev tool at runtime.
  - **Electron is gone.** `mobile-inspect` now starts a loopback service and opens it in an app-mode Chromium
    window using the browser Playwright already installed — the same way Playwright's own Inspector, UI mode
    and Trace Viewer are hosted. With no browser downloaded it prints the URL and says
    `npx playwright install chromium`. The `start` and `inspect:electron` scripts and the duplicate
    `bin/inspect-electron.mjs` launcher are removed.
  - **The transport is SSE + POST instead of WebSocket**, so `ws` is gone too: events stream from
    `GET /events`, commands go to `POST /command` with a monotonic sequence number, and frame _bytes_ are
    fetched from `GET /frame/<id>` rather than base64-encoded into an event. Reload safety comes with it —
    `EventSource` reconnects on its own, and the recording session now belongs to the service launch rather
    than to the connection, so pressing F5 mid-recording keeps the device session, the timeline and the draft.
  - **Prettier is resolved from the project** instead of bundled, so a saved test is formatted by the user's
    own version and `.prettierrc`. A project without Prettier gets an unformatted file and a log line.
  - **One inspector per project.** A second launch is refused with the URL of the first; a lock left behind by
    a crash is reclaimed rather than treated as a conflict.

  ### Fixed
  - A recorded interaction is no longer discarded because its frame id moved on. The frame id is advisory: the
    hierarchy is re-read at action time anyway, so a tap acts on the current screen instead of being dropped
    with only a warning — which is what made clicks "randomly do nothing" while the frame poll was running.
  - Disconnecting a device no longer clears the editor. The draft and timeline describe work the user did and
    survive both a disconnect and the disconnect that `run` performs before it spawns Playwright.
  - The UI's log and run-output buffers are bounded, so a long session (or a device failing on every poll) can
    no longer grow without limit.

  ### `@pwtap/create`

  Both mobile plugin manifests now contribute the shared `mobileApp` fixture from `@pwtap/mobile-core` and
  inject `@pwtap/mobile-inspector` as a devDependency.

### Patch Changes

- 42562d6: Replace the platform compatibility shim with a declared core↔adapter contract, and validate `appSource`.

  `platformCompat.ts` imported `@pwtap/platform` as a namespace and probed each function at load time, so an
  outdated install failed with an upgrade message instead of a module-resolution crash. That treated a
  versioning problem as a runtime problem for the wrong pair of packages: `@pwtap/platform` is a direct
  dependency with a caret range, so npm already resolves a version that has the exports. The shim is deleted.

  The pair that genuinely can disagree is core and adapter, because an adapter is resolved from the client
  project's own `node_modules`. `@pwtap/mobile-core` now exports `MOBILE_CORE_CONTRACT` and
  `MIN_ADAPTER_CONTRACT`, each adapter declares the contract it was built against as a literal
  (`export const contract: AdapterContract = 1`), and discovery skips an adapter it cannot accept while
  reporting which package to upgrade — the inspector logs it, and `DriverNotFoundError` carries it so "no
  driver found" is never the whole story when the adapter is installed but unloadable. One bad adapter does
  not disable the others. The `AdapterContract` type is the exact current value, so bumping the contract
  breaks each adapter's build until someone confirms it still satisfies the new one.

  **`appSource` (ADR-010):** the artifact path comes from a browser field and ends at `adb install` /
  `simctl install` / Appium's `app` capability, so it is now validated before an adapter sees it — an existing
  local `.apk`/`.ipa`/`.zip` file or `.app` bundle directory, or an `https:` URL. Other schemes are refused,
  including `http:`. The adapter receives an absolute path so it never has to guess the base directory, while
  the generated test keeps the path as typed: an absolute one would only work on the machine that recorded it.

### Minor Changes

- c6df135: Add two whole-test evidence capture features, both best-effort (never fail or mask the real test result):

  - `MOBILE_DEVICE_LOG=1` attaches the device's own OS system log (Android `logcat`, iOS the unified system log) as `device-log`. Off by default.
  - Screen recording is **not** a mobile-specific setting — the `maestro` fixture reads Playwright's own built-in `video` option (`use.video` in `playwright.config.ts`), so one central setting governs recording for chromium and maestro alike, honoring all seven of Playwright's video modes (`off`/`on`/`retain-on-failure`/`on-first-retry`/`on-all-retries`/`retain-on-first-failure`/`retain-on-failure-and-retries`, each checked against `testInfo.retry`). Attaches as `maestro-recording`.

- c12d624: Every replayed step now attaches Maestro's real, unedited data for that exact command as `maestro-step-log` — not a synthesized summary. Imperative commands attach the YAML sent over MCP plus Maestro's raw response text; batch YAML steps attach the exact JSON entry Maestro recorded (command + metadata) from `debug/commands-*.json`. A failing step always attaches its log; on a passing step it's opt-in via the new `MOBILE_STEP_LOGS=1` env key, so passing runs stay quiet by default. Also exports `resolveVerboseStepLogs` alongside `resolveScreenshotMode` for bespoke wiring.
- c6df135: ⚠️ Breaking: removed `MOBILE_SCREENSHOT`. Screenshot capture is no longer a mobile-specific setting — the `maestro` fixture now reads Playwright's own built-in `screenshot` option (`use.screenshot` in `playwright.config.ts`, or a project/describe override), the same one `chromium`/`page` tests already use, so one central setting governs both. All four of Playwright's screenshot modes are honored (`off`/`on`/`only-on-failure`/`on-first-failure`, the last collapsing to `only-on-failure` on the first attempt and `off` on any retry). Anyone relying on `MOBILE_SCREENSHOT` should set `use.screenshot` in `playwright.config.ts` instead — the scaffolded template already sets `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'` there, matching the previous default.

  `MaestroMcpSession`'s constructor also changed shape: the trailing positional `screenshotMode`/`binary`/`verboseLogs` parameters are now a single `MaestroSessionOptions` object (`new MaestroMcpSession(device, hooks, { screenshotMode, binary, verboseLogs })`), for anyone constructing it directly for bespoke wiring.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c6df135]
  - @pwtap/platform@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e052a8e: Run mobile tests in parallel (the device pool) and auto-close framework-booted devices. The `maestro` project is now `fullyParallel`, and each test reserves its device with a cross-process lock keyed `<platform>:<device>` — tests on the same device serialize (wait, not skip), while different devices/platforms run concurrently with `--workers=N` (Maestro ≳ 2.6, or `MOBILE_PARALLEL=1`). A `maestro-teardown` project now runs after the suite and shuts down the emulators/simulators the framework auto-booted this run — headed or headless — so they don't linger; set `MOBILE_KEEP_DEVICES=1` to keep them.

### Patch Changes

- cc51ac0: Fix the Maestro binary resolving to an empty string when the injected `MAESTRO_BIN` env key is left blank. The code used `process.env.MAESTRO_BIN ?? 'maestro'`, but `??` doesn't fall back on `''`, so runs spawned an empty command (`spawn '' EACCES` / "file cannot be empty"). Use `|| 'maestro'` so a blank value falls back to the `maestro` binary on PATH.
